# purr 🐾

> A simple mouse event tracker — but beware, this is a gag tool! Use it in **purrduction** at your own risk! 😹

## What is purr?

purr is a claw-some little Python package that tracks your mouse events: moves, clicks, and scrolls — all in one litter box. Whether you’re debugging, testing, or just feline curious, purr keeps an eye on your mouse movements and reports them back with cat-like precision. 🐱

---

## Installation

You can install purr directly from GitHub with pip:

pip install git+https://github.com/nabbonoushad/purr.git

## Usage

Just import purr and call the track() function. It’ll return a list of mouse events that you can paw through however you like:

import purr

purr.track()

## Warning
This tool is more of a cat’s curiosity than a lion’s roar — use it wisely, especially in purrduction environments. It may cause unexpected meow-tivations or sudden naps. 😴
